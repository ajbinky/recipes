    "ingredients": ["1/2 cup Jasmine Rice", "1 Zucchini", "1 Carrot", "1/2 lb Ground Beef", "2 Scallions", "2 tbsp Soy Sauce", "1 tbsp Sesame Oil", "1 tbsp Sugar", "1 tbsp Rice Vinegar", "1 tbsp Gochujang", "1 tbsp Sesame Seeds", "1 tbsp Olive Oil", "Salt", "Pepper", "Vegetable Oil", "1/4 cup Water", "1/4 cup Mayonnaise", "1/2 tsp Sriracha", "1/2 tsp Honey", "1/2 tsp Garlic Powder", "1/2 tsp Onion Powder", "1/2 tsp Paprika", "1/2 tsp Salt", "1/2 tsp Pepper"],
    "instructions": ["Preheat the oven to 425°F. In a small pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 cup of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook, without stirring, 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Remove from heat and fluff the cooked rice with a fork.", "While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the zucchini and carrot; halve lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and green tops. In a bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sriracha, honey, and as much of the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper as you’d like. Stir to combine.", "While the rice continues to cook, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil on medium-high until hot. Add the zucchini, carrot, and white bottoms of the scallions; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until slightly softened. Transfer to a bowl. Wipe out the pan.", "In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the ground beef; season with salt and pepper. Cook, frequently breaking the meat apart with a spoon, 4 to 6 minutes, or until browned and cooked through. Turn off the heat. Carefully drain off and discard any excess grease from the pan.", "While the beef cooks, in a bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, rice vinegar, gochujang, and ¼ cup of water. Stir to combine.", "Add the cooked vegetables and sauce to the pan of beef. Cook on medium-high, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the vegetables are coated. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.", "Divide the cooked rice between 2 dishes. Top with the finished beef and vegetables. Garnish with the green tops of the scallions and sesame seeds. Serve with the spicy mayo on the side. Enjoy!"]
